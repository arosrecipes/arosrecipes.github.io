- one can chick peas
- vegetable broth (optional)
- parchment paper

## Steps
0. Preheat oven to 400
1. Cut cauliflower
2. Make your digestive spice mix.  Use 2tsp cumin and paprica, 1tsp salt, 1/2tsp turmeric, and as much black pepper as you can grind before your arm gives up (max 1tsp).  Mix it up good.
3. Lay cauliflower on baking sheet covered in parchment papper.  Toss with 1tbsp olive oil and half the spice mix.
4. Pour 1/3 can of washed chick peas (2/3 is ideal but there's fodmap in there) onto a paper towel and try thoroughly.  Place on a second baking sheet covered in parchment paper and toss with 1/2tbsp olive oil.
5. In small pot, mix 3/4 cup quinoa with 1 and 1/2 cups broth or water.  Put over high heat uncovered.  Carry on with next steps, and when it boils, cover, turn heat to simmer, and set 14 minute timer to check readiness.
6. Twiddle thumbs for a few minutes or chop a vegetable.
7. Place caulfilower and chick peas in the oven.  Start a 13 minute timer for the cauliflower and chickpeas.
8. Chop your vegetables (carrot, pepper, cucumber, green onion) into appropriate size bits.  If your pepper is on the large side, eat a slice or two.  Place into large mixing bowl.
9. Make your dressing.  Use 3 tbsp Tahini and 3 tsbp olive oil.  Add the juice of about 3/4 of your lemon and a few generous pinches of salt.  Mix until smoothness is achieved, but be wary of overmixing.
10.  When the cauliflower is ready, remove from oven.  The chickpeas generally need a few more minutes to get crunchy.  Drizzle the cauliflower with lemon and possible add some salt.  Dump into large mixing bowl.
11. When chickpeas are ready, dump the other half of the spice mix on them and roll them around.  Dump the peas and the unstuck spice into your large bowl.
12. Dump in the salad dressing and mix.  You're done!
