# Recipe for Tahini Rice Salad aka. The Salad That Aro Will Always Eat

Feeds 2-3 humans.

## Gather
- three large carrots
- cucmuber, about half a medium one

- one bunch of green onions
- sunflower seeds, or pine nuts, or pepitas
- white jasmine rice
- olive oil
- tahini
- turmeric and salt
- maple syrup
- one lemon
- kale, one salad's worth
- vegetable broth (optional)

## Steps
0. Chop your vegetables (carrot, pepper, cucumber, green onion) into appropriate size bits.  If your pepper is on the large side, eat a slice or two.
1. Add 3/4 cup rice and 1-1/2 cup water/broth to pot and place over high heat.  Continue following steps.  When it boils, start a 13 minute timer.  When the timer goes off, do an initial check fo the rice
2. Make your dressing.  Use 3 tbsp Tahini and 3 tsbp olive oil.  Add the juice of about 3/4 of your lemon.  Add roughly 1/2 tsp of turmeric, a few generous pinches of salt, and maybe 2tsp maple syrup.  Mix until smoothness is achieved, but be wary of overmixing.  Adjust spicing until tastes strongly of Turmeric, a little sweet (add syrup as needed), and on the edge of salty.
3. Chop your kale, and add it to the big mixing bowl along with rest of your vegetables and 3tbsp of sunflower seeds
4. When rice is done, dump into the bowl along with dressing.  Mix thoroughly, remembering to reach down to the bottom, where all the good bits tend to go.

## Notes
- The chef-a-hurry may benefit from starting the rice _before_ chopping the vegetables, but only if they can finish all intermediate steps before the rice is ready.
