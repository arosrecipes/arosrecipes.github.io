## Steps
0. Preheat oven to 400
1. Skin your potato and chop into roughly even size pieces.  Mine are maybe 1/3" on a side.
2. Place potato cubes on baking sheet, drizzle with nearly a tbsp of olive oil, season with salt (and paprika if you have it., and toss to coat
3. Add 1/2 cup quinoa and 1 cup water/broth and bring to boil uncovered.  When boiling, cover quinoa and start a 14 minute timer.  When timer goes off and quinoa is cooked, uncover and let cool (stirring occasionally.
4. Meanwhile, place your potatoes in the oven and start a 12 minute timer, which is when you should first check them.  Cook until fibrous texture is gone.
5. Peel and chop your carrots into little carrot slices.  Chop about half of the green part of the green onion.
6. Make your dressing.  Use 2 tbsp Tahini and 2 tsbp olive oil.  Add the juice of about 3/4 of your lemon.  If not creamy add water until creamy (usually unnecessary..  Start by adding roughly 1/2 tsp of turmeric, a few pinches of salt, and maybe 2tsp maple syrup.  Adjust until tastes strongly of Turmeric, not too bitter (add syrup as needed), and on the edge of salty (Taste will be diluted in salad).
7. Put your arugula in the mixing bowl and pick out the gross bits
8. Twiddle thumbs until quinoa and potatoes are cooked and _both have stopped being hot and are more like warm_ (otherwise they will make your arugula gross.)
9. Dump everything in the mixing bowl, including 3tsbp of sunflower seeds.  Mix thoroughly, remembering to reach to bottom, where all the good bits tend to go.
